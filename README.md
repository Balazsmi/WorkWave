This website is a simple Pomodoro Timer that helps you manage your time efficiently by breaking down your work into 25-minute intervals, separated by short breaks.

The website is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate, with a minimalist design that puts the focus on the timer itself.

## Features


**Countdown Timer**: The timer starts at 25 minutes and counts down to 0. When the timer reaches 0, it will alert you with a sound.

**Short Breaks**: After every 25-minute work interval, you will receive a short break of 5 minutes. This will allow you to rest and recharge before the next work interval.

**Long Breaks**: After every 4 work intervals (100 minutes), you will receive a long break of 15 minutes.

**Reset Button**: If you need to start over, simply click the "Reset" button to reset the timer.

## Technologies Used


The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
